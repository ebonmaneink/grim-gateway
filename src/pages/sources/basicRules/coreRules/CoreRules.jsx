      </p>

      <h2>H2. Players and the Game Master</h2>

      <p>A game of Light Omens RPG always needs at least two people:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Players, who each control a single legend known as a Player Character
          (PC). PCs are the heroes of the story.
        </li>

        <li>
          The Game Master (GM), who guides the story, portrays allies and
          adversaries, and challenges the players with obstacles.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>H3. The Players</h3>

      <p>
        Players make choices through their characters; deciding what they
        attempt, rolling dice to see how events unfold, and describing how their
        heroes act in the world. Each player records their character’s details
        on a character sheet, which tracks Attributes, Approaches, Talents,
        Hope, and any active Truths.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. The Game Master</h3>

      <p>The GM’s job is to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Present scenes for the PCs to explore.</li>

        <li>
          Portray NPCs, whether helpful allies, neutral bystanders, or hostile
          foes.
        </li>

        <li>
          Judge the rules, including when a Test is needed and what its
          Difficulty is.
        </li>

        <li>
          Respond to player choices, letting their actions shape the world.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The GM is not an adversary. Their role is to challenge the characters,
        not to “win.” The best games happen when the GM plays as the greatest
        fan of the heroes, pushing them into danger while celebrating their
        triumphs.
      </p>
      <h5>H5. New to Roleplaying Games? (Sidebar)</h5>

      <p>
        A tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) is a shared storytelling adventure.
        Each player pretends to be a character, exploring a world like the ones
        found in favorite books, movies, or shows.
      </p>
      <p>
        One player is the GM, who guides the story, controls NPCs, and makes
        final rulings. The others play PCs, deciding what their heroes say and
        do.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the outcome of an action is uncertain, dice are rolled to see
        whether the attempt succeeds or fails. In Light Omens RPG, you’ll mostly
        roll six-sided dice (d6), sometimes upgrading to twelve-sided dice (d12)
        when your character pushes their limits.
      </p>

      <h2>H2. Dice and Tools</h2>

      <p>
        Light Omens RPG uses a few simple tools to play. Most groups already
        have everything they need at home.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Dice</h3>

      <p>The game uses two kinds of dice.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Six-sided dice (d6) are the core of the BASE6 system. They are used in
          most Tests.
        </li>

        <li>
          Twelve-sided dice (d12) represent heightened skill or extraordinary
          effort. A d12 has a higher chance of success and can roll greater
          results.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you attempt something uncertain, you roll a dice pool. This is a
        handful of dice equal to your character’s Attribute plus Approach. You
        may also upgrade some of your d6 into d12 by spending Hope. (
        <em>Tests are explained fully later.</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        It helps if each player has at least five d6 and five d12 of their own.
      </p>
      <h4>H4. Rerolls</h4>

      <p>
        You may reroll one or more dice of your choice. The new result replaces
        the old one, even if it is worse. You may always keep your original roll
        instead of rerolling.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Paper and Pencils</h3>

      <p>
        Paper and pencils are useful for maps, notes, and tracking important
        details. Players can record temporary effects, NPC names, clues, or
        important events. The GM may also keep notes about the world,
        characters, or story threads. Digital tools like tablets or phones work
        as well, but some groups find they can be distracting.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Tokens and Peripherals</h3>

      <p>You will also need small items to track the game’s resources.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The party should have at least six tokens for Momentum. </li>

        <li>The GM should have at least twelve tokens for Chaos.</li>

        <li>
          Each player may want extra tokens to track Hope, which is unique to
          their character.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tokens can be anything you like. Coins, beads, stones, counters, or even
        slips of paper work fine.
      </p>
      <h2>H2. Characters</h2>

      <p>
        Each player creates a character who is one of the heroes of the story. A
        character is described through a few simple traits that determine what
        they can do and how they do it.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Attributes</h3>

      <p>
        Attributes measure a character’s natural strengths. Each Attribute has a
        rating from 1 to 6.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Body</strong>: Physical strength, endurance, agility, and
          coordination.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Mind</strong>: Reason, knowledge, memory, and awareness.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Soul</strong>: Willpower, intuition, empathy, and presence.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Attributes are combined with Approaches to determine a dice pool when a
        character attempts something uncertain.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Approaches</h3>

      <p>
        Approaches describe how a character acts. Each Approach has a rating
        from 0 to 4.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Force</strong>: Power, direct action, and straightforward
          solutions.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Finesse</strong>: Precision, agility, and delicate technique.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Focus</strong>: Patience, discipline, and concentrated effort.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, Attributes and Approaches define the three cornerstones of the
        BASE6 system: <strong>what you do</strong> (Attribute) and{" "}
        <strong>how you do it</strong> (Approach).
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Talents and Methods</h3>

      <p>
        Every character has Talents, which represent training, skills, or innate
        gifts. Some Talents are broad traits. Others are Methods, which describe
        the unique ways a character combines Attributes and Approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are nine possible Methods in total, one for each Attribute and
        Approach pairing. Methods express the distinct habits and styles of a
        character. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Body + Force = Brute strength and raw power.</li>

        <li>Mind + Finesse = Cleverness, trickery, or tactical precision.</li>

        <li>Soul + Focus = Inner resolve, faith, or calm discipline.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Methods make each hero feel different, even if they share the same
        Attribute ratings.
      </p>
      <h2>H2. Scenes and Truths</h2>

      <p>
        The story of Light Omens RPG unfolds in scenes. A scene is a unit of
        play, like a chapter in a book or a sequence in a movie. It might cover
        a few minutes of tense dialogue, a chase through city streets, or a
        desperate battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the start of each scene, the GM describes where the characters are,
        what is happening, and why it matters. A scene ends once the characters
        have achieved their immediate goal or events move them to a new
        situation.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Setting the Scene</h3>

      <p>
        A scene is defined by the facts that shape it. These facts are called
        Truths. A Truth is a simple statement that is always relevant to the
        situation. Truths tell players what is important and help the GM decide
        what is possible, easier, harder, or impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example Scene Setup</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The GM says: “The tavern is crowded and noisy. Rain pours outside. A
          suspicious guard watches the door.”
        </li>

        <li>
          Truths: Crowded Tavern, Storm Outside, Suspicious Guard at the Door.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>H3. Types of Truths</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Location Truths</strong> describe the environment.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Examples: Burning Forest, Dark Alley, Frozen Wasteland.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Situation Truths</strong> describe events happening right now.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Examples: Panicked Crowd, Bridge Collapsing, Alarm Bells Ringing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Personal Truths </strong>describe the state or quality of a
        character.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Examples: Broken Arm, Overconfident, Hidden Knife.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Equipment Truths</strong> describe objects that matter in the
        scene.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Examples: Ancient Sword, Jammed Rifle, Unstable Explosives.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Truths may be added, changed, or removed as scenes evolve. Players can
        even create or alter Truths by spending Momentum.
      </p>
      <h5>H5. Permission and Difficulty (Sidebar)</h5>

      <p>Truths guide what characters can do.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Because the location is <em>Burning Forest</em>… the GM might increase
          the Difficulty of climbing safely.
        </li>

        <li>
          Because the situation is <em>Panicked Crowd</em>… the GM might say
          sneaking through is impossible.
        </li>

        <li>
          Because the character has a <em>Hidden Knife</em>… they may attempt an
          attack that would otherwise be impossible.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Not every Truth affects every action. Some are just details, while
        others are game-changing.
      </p>
      <h2>H2. Action Tests</h2>

      <p>
        When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the GM calls for a{" "}
        <strong>Test</strong>. A Test decides whether a character succeeds,
        fails, or succeeds with complications.
      </p>
      <p>Not every action needs dice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If success is certain, no roll is required.</li>

        <li>If something is truly impossible, no roll is allowed.</li>

        <li>If success is uncertain, make a Test.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>H3. Attempting a Test</h3>

      <p>Every Test follows the same steps.</p>
      <h4>H4. Step 1. Action Requirements</h4>

      <p>
        The GM chooses the relevant <strong>Attribute </strong>(Body, Mind,
        Soul) and <strong>Approach </strong>(Force, Finesse, Focus). Players may
        suggest combinations, but the GM has the final call.
      </p>
      <h4>H4. Step 2. Action Difficulty</h4>

      <p>
        The GM sets the Difficulty from 0 to 5. This is the number of successes
        needed. Truths may increase or decrease Difficulty.
      </p>
      <h4>H4. Step 3. Build the Dice Pool</h4>

      <p>Add together the chosen Attribute and Approach. Roll that many d6s.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Players may spend Hope to upgrade some of those d6s into d12s (up to
          their Approach rating).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>H4. Step 4. Roll the Dice</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Each die that rolls a<strong> 6 or higher</strong> counts as one
          success.
        </li>

        <li>
          Each die that rolls <strong>10, 11, </strong>or <strong>12</strong>{" "}
          counts as two successes.
        </li>

        <li>Each die that rolls a 1 creates a Complication.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>H4. Step 5. Compare to Difficulty</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>If total successes ≥ Difficulty, the Test is a Triumph.</li>

        <li>If total successes &lt; Difficulty, the Test is a Failure.</li>

        <li>Each success above the Difficulty creates Momentum.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>H4. Step 6. Outcome and Complications</h4>

      <p>
        The GM narrates what happens. The player may spend Momentum to enhance
        the result. Then any Complications take effect.
      </p>
      <h5>H5. Test Example (Sidebar)</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Liora, a Soulful (4) and Focused (2) seeker, tries to decipher a
          magical script.
        </li>

        <li>
          GM sets the Difficulty at 2, with the Truth <em>Ancient Wards</em>{" "}
          making it harder.
        </li>

        <li>
          Liora rolls <strong>6 dice (4 + 2)</strong>. She spends 1 Hope to
          upgrade one die to a d12.
        </li>

        <li>The results: 5, 6, 8, 1, 11 (on d12), 2.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            6, 8, and 11 are successes. The 11 counts as{" "}
            <strong>two successes</strong>. Total = 4 successes.
          </li>

          <li>One die shows a 1, creating a Complication.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>
          Difficulty was 2, so Liora Triumphs with 2 extra successes, generating{" "}
          <strong>2 Momentum</strong>.
        </li>

        <li>
          The GM says: “
          <em>
            You decipher the wards. They speak of a curse. But the Complication
            means your reading has awakened something… you hear whispers in the
            dark.
          </em>
          ”
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>H3. Difficulty and Odds</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Simple (0): always succeed, may roll only to gain Momentum.</li>

        <li>Routine (1): easy, expected to succeed.</li>

        <li>Average (2): standard challenge, needs focus or prep.</li>

        <li>Challenging (3): risky, awards 1 experience if attempted.</li>

        <li>Daunting (4): very hard, requires teamwork or Hope.</li>

        <li>Formidable (5): nearly impossible, only for the bold.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tip: A single d6 has a 16% chance of success. A single d12 has a 58%
        chance. Always look for ways to upgrade dice.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Complications</h3>

      <p>Whenever you roll a 1, you create a Complication.</p>
      <p>Complications never erase success, but they add trouble.</p>
      <p>
        The GM may use them immediately (a dropped weapon, a guard noticing) or
        later (banked as Chaos).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Complication Range</strong>: At higher Difficulties, the risk
        grows. On a Difficulty 3 Test, rolling 1, 2, or 3 all count as
        Complications.
      </p>

      <h2>H2. Momentum</h2>

      <p>
        Momentum is what happens when success goes beyond the minimum. Each
        success over the Difficulty becomes 1 Momentum. Momentum lets you turn
        an ordinary success into something memorable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Momentum is spent in two ways: immediately to improve the outcome of a
        Test, or saved into the group’s shared pool for later use.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Spending Momentum</h3>

      <p>
        After a Test succeeds, the GM describes the basic result. Then the
        player may spend Momentum to shape how the scene plays out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>General Uses of Momentum</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ask a Question (1)</strong>: Learn something the character
          could notice or deduce.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Boost Damage (1+)</strong>: Increase the severity of an Injury
          by +1 per Momentum.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Chain Action (2)</strong>: Take another action right away. The
          next Test is +1 Difficulty.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Create or Alter a Truth (2)</strong>: Add, change, or remove a
          Truth in the scene.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Time Crunch (2)</strong>: Cut the time required for the action
          in half.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some talents, equipment, or short-term effects may grant additional ways
        to spend Momentum.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Saving Momentum</h3>

      <p>
        Any unspent Momentum after a Test can go into the group’s shared pool.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The pool can hold up to 6 Momentum at once.</li>

        <li>Any player can spend from the pool on their turn.</li>

        <li>At the end of each scene, the pool loses 1 Momentum.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        NPCs cannot save Momentum. Instead, their unused Momentum converts to
        Chaos for the GM.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Short-Term Momentum</h3>

      <p>
        Some circumstances grant temporary Momentum (like a weapon feature or
        talent). This extra Momentum must be spent right away. It does not enter
        the group pool.
      </p>
      <h5>H5. Using Momentum Example (Sidebar)</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Karo rolls a Challenging climb (Difficulty 3). He scores 5 successes,
          gaining 2 Momentum.
        </li>

        <li>
          He spends 1 Momentum to <strong>Ask a Question</strong>: “What’s the
          fastest way across these rooftops?”
        </li>

        <li>The GM answers: “You notice a rope bridge two zones over.”</li>

        <li>
          He saves the other Momentum into the group pool. Later, his ally uses
          it to Create a Truth: Loose Roof Tiles that make enemies stumble.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Momentum makes every extra success matter. Players can push scenes in
        bold, creative directions, while the GM weaves those choices into the
        unfolding story.
      </p>
      <h2>H2. Chaos</h2>

      <p>
        Where players earn Momentum, the GM gathers <strong>Chaos</strong>.
        Chaos is the uncertainty, danger, and hostility pressing back against
        the heroes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chaos enters play through player risks, enemy actions, and
        complications. The GM spends Chaos to intensify threats, alter the
        scene, or give adversaries an edge.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. How Chaos Grows</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Complications</strong>: Whenever a 1 is rolled, the GM may
          take Chaos instead of using the Complication immediately.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Escalation</strong>: If a character takes a reckless or risky
          action, the GM may award Chaos.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Chaotic Circumstances</strong>: Some scenes begin with extra
          Chaos if the situation is especially unstable.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>NPC Momentum</strong>: NPCs cannot save Momentum. Instead,
          their extra successes become Chaos.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>H3. Spending Chaos</h3>

      <p>The GM may spend Chaos to change the flow of the story.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Common Uses of Chaos</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>NPC Advantage</strong>: Spend as if the NPC had Momentum or
          Hope. This might mean extra damage, rerolls, or adding new dice.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Cancel Complication (2)</strong>: Remove a Complication that
          would affect an NPC.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Inflict Complication (2)</strong>: Force a PC to suffer a
          Complication and apply a negative Truth.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Reinforcements (1 each)</strong>: Add new NPCs into the scene.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Environmental Twist (1+)</strong>: Change the scene itself.
          Examples: a storm intensifies, fire spreads, or the ground collapses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Chaos is flexible. The GM’s job is not to punish players but to heighten
        drama, push tension, and make the world feel alive and dangerous.
      </p>
      <h5>H5. Chaos in Action Example (Sidebar)</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The party sneaks through an ancient ruin. A Complication is rolled:{" "}
          <em>Loose Stones</em>. The GM could apply it immediately, but instead
          banks it as 1 Chaos.
        </li>

        <li>
          Later, during combat, the GM spends that Chaos to trigger the collapse
          of part of the ceiling. A new Location Truth enters play:{" "}
          <em>Falling Debris</em>.
        </li>

        <li>
          Now the players must act quickly, dealing not only with enemies but
          also the unstable environment.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Tone Note</strong>: Chaos is the GM’s mirror to Momentum, but it
        should always feel like the story is biting back. Every point spent
        raises suspense or makes victory more meaningful.
      </p>
      <h2>H2. Hope</h2>

      <p>
        Hope is a character’s spark. It is their belief, willpower, and inner
        fire. It lets them defy impossible odds, push beyond their limits, and
        keep fighting when everything seems lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each player character begins with a pool of Hope points. Spending Hope
        lets you alter dice, avoid defeat, or fuel unique talents.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Spending Hope</h3>

      <p>
        You may spend Hope at any time during a Test or in response to danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Common Uses of Hope</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Upgrade Dice (1 each)</strong>: Change a d6 in your pool to a
          d12 (up to your Approach rating).
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Reroll Dice (1)</strong>: Reroll up to two dice.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Avoid Injury (variable)</strong>: Spend Hope equal to the
          damage rating to prevent an Injury. (Armor reduces the cost, but at
          least 1 Hope must be spent.)
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Talent Triggers</strong>: Some abilities require Hope to
          activate.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>H3. Hopelessness</h3>

      <p>
        When a character’s Hope drops to 0, they gain the Truth{" "}
        <strong>
          <em>Hopeless</em>
        </strong>
        . This is not permanent but represents a collapse of will or spirit.
      </p>
      <p>A hopeless character:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Locks one Approach, depending on how despair takes hold:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Weakened </em>→ Force is locked.
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Clumsy </em>→ Finesse is locked.
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Distracted </em>→ Focus is locked.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <li>Cannot spend Hope until they recover.</li>

        <li>
          Automatically suffers 1 Complication whenever using another Approach.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hopelessness is temporary, but it always matters. It means the character
        has hit a breaking point, and the story should reflect that.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Recovering Hope</h3>

      <p>Hope comes back through rest, encouragement, or risking everything.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ways to Regain Hope</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Gain Favor</strong>: Spend Momentum after a successful Test to
          restore up to 3 Hope (to yourself or an ally who sees your action).
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Tempt Fate</strong>: Before making a Test, generate 1 Chaos to
          restore up to 3 Hope.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Drives</strong>: Each character has a Drive (a core belief or
          trait). Acting on it may restore Hope.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Rest</strong>:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em>Quick Rest</em> (minutes): +2 Hope.
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Short Rest</em> (1–2 hours): +4 Hope.
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Long Rest</em> (overnight): +6 Hope.
          </li>

          <li>
            <em>Downtime </em>(several safe days): fully restores Hope.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>H3. Handling Hopelessness</h3>

      <p>A hopeless character recovers after a rest or with help.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An ally may attempt a <strong>Plan and Prepare</strong> action
          (Difficulty 2) to lift Hopelessness. Success removes the Hopeless
          Truth and restores 1 Hope to both characters.
        </li>

        <li>A character who suffers Hopelessness gains experience.</li>

        <li>
          A character who helps an ally recover from Hopelessness also gains
          experience.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>H5. Hope in Action Example (Sidebar)</h5>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Jalen faces a Formidable (5) Test to hold a collapsing bridge while
          his allies cross. His Body (3) and Force (2) give him 5 dice. He
          spends 2 Hope to upgrade two dice into d12s.
        </li>

        <li>
          His roll: 1, 6, 7, 10 (d12), 12 (d12). That’s 5 successes exactly. The
          bridge holds.
        </li>

        <li>
          But he also rolled a 1, creating a Complication:{" "}
          <em>Strained Muscles</em>.
        </li>

        <li>
          Later, drained from battle, Jalen’s Hope hits 0. He becomes Weakened
          (Hopeless), losing access to Force, and gaining 1 experience. His ally
          Lyra makes a heartfelt speech, rolling a Soul (Focus) Plan and Prepare
          Test, and succeeds. Together, both regain 1 Hope and Lyra gains 1
          experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>H2. Conflict</h2>

      <p>
        Conflict plays out in <strong>rounds</strong>. Each round, every
        character or group of NPCs takes one turn.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The GM selects the first character to act in the first round.</li>

        <li>
          When a character finishes their turn, their player chooses who acts
          next.
        </li>

        <li>
          The last character to act in a round may choose who begins the next
          round (including themselves).
        </li>

        <li>
          A character may interrupt the order by spending 1 Momentum (or 2 Chaos
          if an NPC).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This “passing the spotlight” keeps action unpredictable and dynamic.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Movement and Zones</h3>

      <p>
        The battlefield is divided into zones; abstract areas like the tavern
        bar, the balcony, or the alley outside.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          On your turn, you may move <strong>1 zone </strong>for free.
        </li>

        <li>
          You may move <strong>1 extra zone</strong> if you spend{" "}
          <strong>1 Momentum</strong> or increase the Difficulty of your action
          by +1.
        </li>

        <li>Difficult terrain may require Momentum or a Test to cross.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Examples</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Same zone</strong>: A melee attack can reach any target in
          your zone.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Adjacent zones</strong>: Ranged attacks have no penalty.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Farther zones</strong>: Each zone beyond adjacent adds +1
          Difficulty.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>H3. Actions</h3>

      <p>
        On your turn, you may take <strong>1 action</strong>. All actions fall
        into four broad types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Advance and Attack</strong>: Strike at a foe with a weapon,
          spell, or words. (Usually a Test or Contest.)
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Evade and Endure</strong>: Withstand or dodge danger, such as
          fire, poison, or falling rubble.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Improvise and Interact</strong>: Try something creative, like
          grabbing a rope, distracting a guard, or dismantling a machine.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Plan and Prepare</strong>: Create, change, or remove a Truth.
          Base Difficulty 2.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>H4. Advance and Attack</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Melee attacks are usually Difficulty 1.</li>

        <li>Ranged attacks usually Difficulty 2.</li>

        <li>If successful, the target suffers an Injury.</li>

        <li>
          Defenders may counter: spend 2 Momentum to strike back as if they had
          succeeded on an attack.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>: Veyra shoots across the marketplace
        (Difficulty 2). She rolls 4 successes, inflicting Injury and gaining 2
        Momentum. She spends 1 to boost damage, raising the wound severity.
      </p>
      <h4>H4. Evade and Endure</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Used against hazards, traps, or overwhelming forces.</li>

        <li>Success avoids harm; failure means the full consequence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>: A collapsing wall threatens the party. Taron
        makes a Mind (Finesse) roll to duck aside. He succeeds, but rolls a 1:
        he’s safe, but dust blinds him (Temporary Truth: <em>Eyes Stinging</em>
        ).
      </p>
      <h4>H4. Improvise and Interact</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Covers everything outside of direct attack or defense.</li>

        <li>May allow unusual strategies, distractions, or clever tricks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>: Lyra flips the banquet table to block arrows,
        rolling Soul (Force). On success, she creates the Truth{" "}
        <em>Makeshift Cover</em>.
      </p>
      <h4>H4. Plan and Prepare</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Used to influence the battlefield with Truths.</li>

        <li>Base Difficulty 2.</li>

        <li>Success adds, alters, or removes a Truth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>: Jalen chants a warding spell. On success, the
        GM adds the Truth Protective Sigils to the scene.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Injuries</h3>

      <p>
        When an attack or hazard connects, it inflicts an{" "}
        <strong>Injury</strong>; a negative Truth representing wounds, trauma,
        or conditions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Every Injury has a damage rating (1–6).</li>

        <li>
          Each point of Momentum spent on damage increases the rating by +1.
        </li>

        <li>Unarmed, or generic, attacks default to damage rating 1.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Special Injuries may represent fear, despair, humiliation, or confusion,
        not just physical wounds. These may fade at the scene's end or linger
        like normal Injuries.
      </p>
      <h4>H4. Avoiding Injuries</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Spend Hope equal to the damage rating (minus armor) to avoid the
          Injury. Minimum 1 Hope must be spent.
        </li>

        <li>
          Instead, you may sacrifice armor, destroying it but avoiding Injury.
        </li>

        <li>NPCs avoid Injury by spending Chaos.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>H5. Delaying the Inevitable (Sidebar)</h5>

      <p>
        If you cannot pay full Hope, you may spend what you have. The Injury is
        delayed until the end of the scene.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Injury and Defeat</h3>

      <p>
        When a character suffers an Injury, they are also{" "}
        <strong>Defeated </strong>for the scene. Defeat represents being
        incapacitated, overwhelmed, or out of action.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Allies may attempt a Difficulty 2 Test to bring a Defeated character
          back mid-scene.
        </li>

        <li>
          At the end of the scene, defeated characters recover enough to act,
          but the Injury remains.
        </li>

        <li>
          Healing requires rest and rehabilitation (several long rests equal to
          twice the Injury’s damage rating).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a defeated character suffers another Injury, they may die. Some
        attacks are outright deadly and kill in one blow.
      </p>
      <h5>H5. Willing to Die (Sidebar)</h5>

      <p>
        A character may declare they are willing to die. They immediately
        recover all Hope and gain 1 Hope at the start of every action. If they
        suffer any Injury, they perish.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>H5. Conflict Round Example (Sidebar)</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Round begins: GM chooses Karo to act first.</li>

        <li>
          Karo charges an enemy (Advance and Attack, Difficulty 1). He rolls 3
          successes, Triumphs, and generates 2 Momentum. He spends 1 to boost
          damage, 1 to chain into a second strike at Difficulty 2.
        </li>

        <li>
          Karo’s player chooses Lyra to act next. She uses Plan and Prepare,
          succeeding in creating the Truth Chandelier Falling.
        </li>

        <li>
          Lyra chooses the enemy commander to act next. The GM spends 2 Chaos to
          interrupt: reinforcements arrive, changing the battle.
        </li>
        <li>
          The round continues until all have acted. The last to act chooses who
          begins the next round.
        </li>
      </ul>
