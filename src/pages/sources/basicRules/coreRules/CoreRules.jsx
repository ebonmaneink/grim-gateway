      </p>

      <h2>H2. Players and the Game Master</h2>

      <p>A game of Light Omens RPG always needs at least two people:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Players, who each control a single legend known as a Player Character
          (PC). PCs are the heroes of the story.
        </li>

        <li>
          The Game Master (GM), who guides the story, portrays allies and
          adversaries, and challenges the players with obstacles.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>H3. The Players</h3>

      <p>
        Players make choices through their characters; deciding what they
        attempt, rolling dice to see how events unfold, and describing how their
        heroes act in the world. Each player records their character’s details
        on a character sheet, which tracks Attributes, Approaches, Talents,
        Hope, and any active Truths.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. The Game Master</h3>

      <p>The GM’s job is to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Present scenes for the PCs to explore.</li>

        <li>
          Portray NPCs, whether helpful allies, neutral bystanders, or hostile
          foes.
        </li>

        <li>
          Judge the rules, including when a Test is needed and what its
          Difficulty is.
        </li>

        <li>
          Respond to player choices, letting their actions shape the world.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The GM is not an adversary. Their role is to challenge the characters,
        not to “win.” The best games happen when the GM plays as the greatest
        fan of the heroes, pushing them into danger while celebrating their
        triumphs.
      </p>
      <h5>H5. New to Roleplaying Games? (Sidebar)</h5>

      <p>
        A tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) is a shared storytelling adventure.
        Each player pretends to be a character, exploring a world like the ones
        found in favorite books, movies, or shows.
      </p>
      <p>
        One player is the GM, who guides the story, controls NPCs, and makes
        final rulings. The others play PCs, deciding what their heroes say and
        do.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the outcome of an action is uncertain, dice are rolled to see
        whether the attempt succeeds or fails. In Light Omens RPG, you’ll mostly
        roll six-sided dice (d6), sometimes upgrading to twelve-sided dice (d12)
        when your character pushes their limits.
      </p>

      <h2>H2. Dice and Tools</h2>

      <p>
        Light Omens RPG uses a few simple tools to play. Most groups already
        have everything they need at home.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Dice</h3>

      <p>The game uses two kinds of dice.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Six-sided dice (d6) are the core of the BASE6 system. They are used in
          most Tests.
        </li>

        <li>
          Twelve-sided dice (d12) represent heightened skill or extraordinary
          effort. A d12 has a higher chance of success and can roll greater
          results.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you attempt something uncertain, you roll a dice pool. This is a
        handful of dice equal to your character’s Attribute plus Approach. You
        may also upgrade some of your d6 into d12 by spending Hope. (
        <em>Tests are explained fully later.</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        It helps if each player has at least five d6 and five d12 of their own.
      </p>
      <h4>H4. Rerolls</h4>

      <p>
        You may reroll one or more dice of your choice. The new result replaces
        the old one, even if it is worse. You may always keep your original roll
        instead of rerolling.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Paper and Pencils</h3>

      <p>
        Paper and pencils are useful for maps, notes, and tracking important
        details. Players can record temporary effects, NPC names, clues, or
        important events. The GM may also keep notes about the world,
        characters, or story threads. Digital tools like tablets or phones work
        as well, but some groups find they can be distracting.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Tokens and Peripherals</h3>

      <p>You will also need small items to track the game’s resources.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The party should have at least six tokens for Momentum. </li>

        <li>The GM should have at least twelve tokens for Chaos.</li>

        <li>
          Each player may want extra tokens to track Hope, which is unique to
          their character.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tokens can be anything you like. Coins, beads, stones, counters, or even
        slips of paper work fine.
      </p>
      <h2>H2. Characters</h2>

      <p>
        Each player creates a character who is one of the heroes of the story. A
        character is described through a few simple traits that determine what
        they can do and how they do it.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Attributes</h3>

      <p>
        Attributes measure a character’s natural strengths. Each Attribute has a
        rating from 1 to 6.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Body</strong>: Physical strength, endurance, agility, and
          coordination.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Mind</strong>: Reason, knowledge, memory, and awareness.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Soul</strong>: Willpower, intuition, empathy, and presence.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Attributes are combined with Approaches to determine a dice pool when a
        character attempts something uncertain.
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Approaches</h3>

      <p>
        Approaches describe how a character acts. Each Approach has a rating
        from 0 to 4.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Force</strong>: Power, direct action, and straightforward
          solutions.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Finesse</strong>: Precision, agility, and delicate technique.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Focus</strong>: Patience, discipline, and concentrated effort.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, Attributes and Approaches define the three cornerstones of the
        BASE6 system: <strong>what you do</strong> (Attribute) and{" "}
        <strong>how you do it</strong> (Approach).
      </p>
      <h3>H3. Talents and Methods</h3>

      <p>
        Every character has Talents, which represent training, skills, or innate
        gifts. Some Talents are broad traits. Others are Methods, which describe
        the unique ways a character combines Attributes and Approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are nine possible Methods in total, one for each Attribute and
        Approach pairing. Methods express the distinct habits and styles of a
        character. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Body + Force = Brute strength and raw power.</li>

        <li>Mind + Finesse = Cleverness, trickery, or tactical precision.</li>

        <li>Soul + Focus = Inner resolve, faith, or calm discipline.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Methods make each hero feel different, even if they share the same
        Attribute ratings.
      </p>
